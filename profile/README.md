# SEBI Protocol âœ¨
Building global equity-based investments platform on-chain.

## Why Building SEBI Protocol?
Despite being such a happening place, DeFi is comparatively much smaller than traditional finance and stock markets. While blockchain has emerged as the technology that enables a permissionless and open internet, the average individual still considers DeFi/crypto as gambling due to speculation and the lack of a governing body to ensure fair practices.

SEBI Protocol is designed to introduce investment rules for businesses similar to those in stock markets, with community-based governance rather than an individual body.

This creates an opportunity for retail investors to join blockchain-based investments and bring in more capital.
